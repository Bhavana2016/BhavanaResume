Project Experience:

GSM based motor monitoring system, Kent State University**

Location: Kent, OH                                                                                           Jan 2016 – April 2016

Designed a system, which allows the user to effectively control the house/office
appliances by using the mobile phone set by sending commands in the form of
SMS. Using this proposed system we can operate from any location where device
can receive signal. For this we used microcontrollers, relays and registers.

Languages/tools:RIDE

Course Management System, Kent State University

Location: Kent, OH                                                                                           May 2015 – Dec 2015

Created Building blocks for the Blackboard, which is a tool used by university to
manage the course structure. I’ve done manual testing and bug fixes for the
building blocks.

Tools: Java, Testing Tools

Event Organizing System, Kent State University

Location: Kent, OH                                                                                           Jan 2014 – May 2014

This project is to schedule events online
conveniently and reserve the rooms for any event by an authorized personnel. We
can set reminder as well for the particular event scheduled. Using this System
we can Edit/View or Delete existing Event.

Languages/tools: Visual Basic, CSS, HTML

Driver fatigue monitoring and control system, JNTU

Location: Hyderabad, India                                                                              Jan 2014 – May 2014

Designed a method to decrease the number of accidents,
which is one of the major problems today. Two sensors on both sides of the
steering wheel are fixed and a vibrator along with an alarm is fixed under the
seat of the driver, which is in touch with his body. Whenever the pressure on
the sensors applied is less than the preset pressure, the vibrator vibrates and
helps the driver to get alerted. All this happens with the help of ICs,
filters, relays and DAQ interface. 

Languages/tools: labView

Automatic sorting of metallic and non-metallic elements using PLC, JNTU**

Location: Hyderabad, India                                                                              Jan 2013 – May 2013

Designed a method to sort the metallic
and non-metallic elements within less time and without manpower. For this we
need a conveyer belt, height detectors and gas cylinders. Whenever the element
is a metal it is pushed into a bin with the help of the cylinders and if it is
a non-metal it is pushed into another bin. All this happens with the help of
MATLAB.

Languages/tools: MATLAB

Co- Curricular Activities:

Member of Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (**IEEE) **since 2010. 

Presented papers on Cloud Computing, Holographic Data Storage, Airborne Internet, Li- Fi.

Worked as Chair Person for IEEE with SriDevi Women’s Engineering College (2013-2014)

Participated in many IEEE events like convergence (2011, 2012), synapse (2014).
